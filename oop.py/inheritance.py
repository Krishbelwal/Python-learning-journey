# inheritance - include one class property in any other class and  also can extend  class with using inheritance.
# when a class derives from a child class it is known inheriatnce. this child class automatice inherit properties(public and private) and methods from parent class. and additinal we can add some more properties and methods  .it is called inheritance.
# class student:
#        def __init__(self , Name , id):
#           self.name = Name
#           self.id = id
#        def print(self):
#         print(f"The Name is: {self.name} and his id is: {self.id}")
# But if someone say us to do change student class for some reason but we have done lot of things with this class and we doesn'nt want to change it so in that condition we needed inheritance-
# class programmmer(student):
#        def rollno(self , no):
#             self.rollno = no
#             print(f" and his roll no. is:{self.rollno}")
# b = programmmer("krish" , 456)
# b.print()
# b.rollno(45)
